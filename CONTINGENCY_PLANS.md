# CONTINGENCY PLANS

**Status:** ALTERNATIVE EXECUTION PATHS
**Purpose:** If Plan A (synchronized launch) fails, execute Plan B/C
**Scope:** Launch delays, market changes, resource constraints

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN A: STAGGERED LAUNCH

**Trigger:** 1-2 companies not ready by Mar 3

**Procedure:**

**Option A1: Launch by Readiness (Recommended)**
- Launch ready companies on Mar 3
- Launch subsequent companies as ready (within 48 hours)
- Messaging: "Phased launch for optimal experience"

**Timeline:**
- Mar 3: HōMI + Bolt go live (highest readiness)
- Mar 4: Prompting It goes live (+24 hours)
- Mar 5: Quant + TrustMove go live (+48 hours)

**Advantage:**
- Don't delay everything for 1 company
- Launch momentum not completely lost
- Companies not held back by slower ones

**Disadvantage:**
- Loses synchronized impact
- Platform effects delayed (cross-company integrations)
- Messaging complexity increases

**Go/No-Go:** CEO decision if any company <80% ready by Feb 28

---

**Option A2: Company-Specific Delay**
- If Prompting It not ready: Launch HōMI/Bolt/Quant/TrustMove on Mar 3
- Prompting It launches separately (Mar 10-17)
- Marketplace ecosystem can wait

**Advantage:**
- Don't delay housing/credit/trust platforms
- Prompting It can take more time

**Disadvantage:**
- Lost synergy (housing platform benefits from marketplace)
- Perceived as incomplete

**Go/No-Go:** CEO decision if Prompting It >2 weeks away from ready

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN B: MINIMAL VIABLE LAUNCH

**Trigger:** Multiple blockers unresolved by Feb 26

**Procedure:**

**Option B1: Launch Core Features Only**
- Launch each company with MVP feature set
- All nice-to-have features deferred to v1.1
- Focus: Get real users, learn what they want

**Example:**
- HōMI: Agent network MVP (basic onboarding, limited integrations)
- Bolt: Credit system MVP (distribution + basic pricing)
- Prompting It: Creator marketplace MVP (upload + purchase)
- Quant: Analytics dashboard MVP (basic metrics)
- TrustMove: MVP validation (user cohort, data collection)

**Timeline:**
- Reduce scope immediately (Day 1 of blocker delay)
- v1.0 minimal: Mar 3 (original date)
- v1.1 full feature: Mar 24 (+3 weeks)

**Advantage:**
- Hit launch date
- Get real user feedback immediately
- Iterate faster with real data

**Disadvantage:**
- Product feels incomplete
- User experience may be rough
- Competitive vulnerability

**Go/No-Go:** CEO decision by Feb 24 if multiple blockers unresolved

---

**Option B2: Launch Selected Companies Only**
- If 2+ companies blocked: Launch the ready ones (3 companies)
- Blocked companies deferred to April
- Focus execution on what's working

**Example:**
- Mar 3: HōMI + Bolt + TrustMove (3 ready companies)
- Apr 1: Prompting It + Quant (if still blocked in March)

**Advantage:**
- Don't delay the winners
- Focus resources where succeeding

**Disadvantage:**
- Platform feels incomplete
- Lost synergies for 1 month

**Go/No-Go:** CEO decision by Feb 26 if >2 companies stuck

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN C: EXTENDED PREP

**Trigger:** Multiple critical issues found in pre-launch testing (Feb 28)

**Procedure:**

**Delay Launch 1-2 Weeks**
- New date: Mar 10-17
- Extra validation week: Mar 3-9
- Use time to:
  - Run full security audit
  - Complete load testing
  - Iterate on UX/product
  - Finalize marketing

**Timeline:**
- Mar 3-9: Extended prep week
- Mar 10: Launch

**Advantage:**
- Higher quality launch
- More market testing time
- Reduced crisis risk

**Disadvantage:**
- 1-2 week delay announced
- Team fatigue (extended prep is hard)
- Market window may close

**Conditions for Plan C:**
- >3 blocker issues unresolved
- Critical security concerns
- >2 companies not market-ready
- Major infrastructure concerns

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN D: SOFT LAUNCH

**Trigger:** Want to launch but want to be cautious

**Procedure:**

**Soft Launch to Limited Audience (Feb 28 - Mar 14)**

**Phase 1: Closed Beta** (Weeks 1-2)
- Invite first 500 beta users (pre-registered + referrals)
- Limited features (MVP)
- Daily feedback collection
- Plan for v1.1 based on feedback

**Phase 2: Public Launch** (Mar 17)
- All features + feedback improvements
- Marketing campaign at scale
- Full company launch

**Timeline:**
- Feb 28: Invite 500 beta users
- Mar 3-14: Beta feedback collection
- Mar 14: Incorporate feedback
- Mar 17: Full public launch

**Advantage:**
- De-risk the launch
- Get feedback before full market launch
- Iterate quickly with motivated users
- Can adjust messaging based on feedback

**Disadvantage:**
- Delays "big launch" by 2 weeks
- Beta users may become critical (negative feedback)
- Need to manage expectations

**Go/No-Go:** If Product wants to de-risk, Operator recommends this

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN E: MARKET-BASED PIVOTS

**Trigger:** Real-time market feedback requires strategy change

### PIVOT E1: Pivot Target Market

**Trigger:** Initial market rejects primary target, adjacent market wants product

**Example:**
- TrustMove targets homebuyers, but gets adoption from renters
- Pivot positioning: "Renter trust network" instead of "homebuyer"
- Adjust marketing/messaging accordingly

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Identify opportunity
- Week 2: Create pivot messaging
- Week 3: Test with new messaging
- Week 4: Full pivot if successful

**Activation:**
- CEO approval (same day)
- Brand agent creates new messaging (24 hours)
- Marketing shifts immediately
- Product may need tweaks (backlog for v1.1)

### PIVOT E2: Pivot Revenue Model

**Trigger:** Initial pricing doesn't work, need different model

**Example:**
- Bolt credit system: Try subscription instead of transaction fees
- Pricing: $9.99/month instead of 5% per transaction
- Change if it improves retention/revenue

**Timeline:**
- Week 2: Analyze pricing performance
- Week 3: Model alternative (if needed)
- Week 4: Test with segment
- Week 5: Decide to pivot or maintain

### PIVOT E3: Pivot Distribution Channel

**Trigger:** Direct marketing not working, partnership opportunity emerges

**Example:**
- HōMI: Direct homebuyer acquisition slow
- Partnership opportunity: Zillow API integration
- New strategy: Reach HōMI users through Zillow

**Timeline:**
- Week 1-2: Identify partnership
- Week 3: Negotiate terms
- Week 4: Integrate
- Week 5: Launch via partnership

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN F: RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

**Trigger:** Key person leaves, budget cut, infrastructure issues

### PLAN F1: Key Person Departure

**If Principal Leaves:**
1. Deputy assumes role (pre-identified)
2. CEO provides intensive support (daily check-ins)
3. Contractor/consultant hired within 48 hours (if needed)
4. Timeline impact: <1 week delay

**If Infrastructure Lead Leaves:**
1. Infrastructure Agent takes over
2. Audit performed (48 hours)
3. Contractor hired (72 hours)
4. Timeline impact: <1 week delay

**If Multiple Leaves:**
- Escalate to CEO: May trigger Plan C (extended prep) or Plan D (soft launch)

### PLAN F2: Budget Cut (10-30%)

**If 10% cut:**
- Marketing spend reduced proportionally
- Hiring delayed 1-2 weeks
- Continue launch timeline

**If 20% cut:**
- Marketing spend cut 30% (accept lower acquisition)
- Hiring frozen
- Timeline at risk, may shift to Plan B (MVP features only)

**If 30%+ cut:**
- Likely triggers Plan C (extended prep) or Plan D (soft launch)
- Reduced scope
- Reduced company count possible

### PLAN F3: Infrastructure Capacity Issues

**If 50% over capacity:**
- Auto-scaling may not be sufficient
- Options:
  - A: Add expensive emergency capacity (cost increase)
  - B: Limit launch to 3 companies (reduce load)
  - C: Delay launch 1 week, add capacity

**Trigger:** Infrastructure audit Feb 26 shows >50% overallocation

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN G: COMPETITIVE THREAT

**Trigger:** Competitor launches same day / Better-funded competitor enters

### Response Framework:

**If Similar Product Launches:**
1. Day 1: Analyze competitive threat
2. Day 2: Identify differentiation (what we do better)
3. Day 3: Adjust messaging (emphasize differentiation)
4. Day 4: Marketing push with differentiation focus

**Messaging Change:**
- Not "we're X"
- Instead: "we're X, which is better than competitor because..."

**Product Response:**
- Add 1-2 features competitor lacks (fast iteration)
- Publish blog post: "What makes us different"
- Get early users to write testimonials

**Timeline:**
- Market moves fast, respond within 48 hours
- No delay to launch needed
- Adjust messaging + marketing

### If Better-Funded Competitor:

1. Day 1: Acknowledge reality
2. Day 2: Assess if we can compete
3. Decision:
   - **A: Compete** - Accelerate feature development, don't cut scope
   - **B: Partner** - Explore acquisition/partnership
   - **C: Pivot** - Enter different market segment

**Go/No-Go:** CEO decision within 2 days of competitor announcement

---

## CONTINGENCY PLAN H: MARKET CONDITIONS CHANGE

**Trigger:** Economic downturn, interest rate shock, etc.

### Response:

**If Market Downturn:**
- User acquisition may be slower
- Plan for 50% slower growth initially
- Shift to retention/unit economics focus
- Extend runway by 6 months

**Timeline Impact:**
- Launch date: No change
- Growth trajectory: May take 2x longer to hit targets
- Resource needs: May be higher (compete for resources)

**Strategic Response:**
- Focus on profitable unit economics (not just growth)
- Build financial products that help during downturn
- Position as solution to economic pressure

**Go/No-Go:** Monitor macroeconomic conditions through Feb 28
- If recession likely: Prepare contingency messaging
- If confirmed: Adjust growth targets, but launch still valid

## CONTINGENCY DECISION PROTOCOL

**When to Trigger Contingency Plan:**

**Daily (6:00am):**
- Infrastructure review: Any capacity concerns?
- Team health: Any departures?
- Blocker status: Any stalled?

**Weekly (Friday 4:00pm):**
- Comprehensive contingency review
- Are we on track for primary plan (A)?
- Do we need contingency activation?

**Gate Decision (Feb 14, 28, Mar 3):**
- Formal contingency assessment
- CEO decision: Primary or Contingency Plan?
- Communicate decision to team/stakeholders

---

## COMMUNICATION DURING CONTINGENCY ACTIVATION

**To Team:**
- Transparent about why contingency activated
- New timeline explained
- What changes vs original plan
- How this improves outcomes

**To Investors:**
- This was planned for
- Shows adaptability
- Actually reduces risk
- Better to pivot early than fail late

**To Customers:**
- Delayed launch = better product
- Soft launch shows confidence
- Different approach is intentional
- Quality focus = value for you

---

**All contingency plans have been tested mentally. Team knows the alternatives. Ready to execute Plan A or contingency as needed.**
